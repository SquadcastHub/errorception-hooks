### HipChat

Sends a message to your HipChat room whever an error occurs.

* Get your API Token from HipChat's [API Tokens](https://www.hipchat.com/admin/api) page. Errorception only needs a notification token, not an admin token.
* If 'trigger notifications in the room' is checked, HipChat will change the tab color, play a sound, etc. Each recipient's notification preferences are taken into account.
